Cursor AI Coding Rules for Chess Project

1. Commit and Push Behavior
- After every meaningful change, create a clear and descriptive commit.
- Use short but informative commit messages. Example commit messages:
  - "Add join game screen"
  - "Fix client connection issue"
  - "Refactor server communication"
- After committing, immediately push the changes to the remote GitHub repository.
- Do not bundle unrelated changes into a single commit. Each commit must represent a logical unit of work.

2. Code Comments
- All comments must be written in English.
- Write clear and concise comments explaining complex logic, function purposes, and important decisions.
- Example comment:
  // Connect to the server using the provided IP address

- Avoid unnecessary comments for obvious code.

3. Server Update and Deployment
If a change is made on the server-side (server code modifications):

- Rebuild the server application as a `.jar` file (chess-server.jar).

- Connect to the server using the following SSH command:
  ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 ubuntu@141.147.25.123

- Copy the updated chess-server.jar file to the server:
  scp -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 chess-server.jar ubuntu@141.147.25.123:~/chess-server/

- After copying, SSH into the server:
  ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 ubuntu@141.147.25.123

- Navigate to the server folder:
  cd ~/chess-server/

- Restart the server application using pm2:
  pm2 restart chess-server

- Always verify that the server is running properly after restarting. 
- If there are any errors during deployment, fix them immediately before continuing client development.

4. General Best Practices
- Keep the code clean and well-organized.
- Follow consistent formatting (indentation, brackets, spacing).
- Prioritize readability over unnecessary complexity.
- If unsure about an implementation, prefer simple and maintainable solutions first, then optimize if needed.
